## Configuring Your Site
On startup, Amphora will look through the `/sites` directory for the sites it needs to start. It will use the site's `sites/site-name/config.yml` file to configure each site. Below are a list of standard properties, additional properties may be added in order to be accessed through the `locals.site` object that is passed on requests.
