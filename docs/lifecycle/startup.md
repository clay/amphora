# Startup Life Cycle

The startup life cycle is meant to do a few main things:

1. Setup any Amphora Plugins
2. Register any sites and setup core routes
3. Seed the database with any default data

All of these processes are coordinated in [`setup.js`](https://github.com/clay/amphora/blob/master/lib/setup.js).
