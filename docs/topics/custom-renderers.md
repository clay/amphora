# Custom Renderers

> #### warning::API Notice
> The docs address the renderer API as of Amphora v6.x. For information on the version 4.x and 5.x API's please [submit an issue](github.com/clay/amphora/issues/new).

A custom renderer can do anything your needs might require when it comes to transforming JSON data from Amphora. All that is required is that your renderer export a `render` function. This function will receive a the arguments described below:

- `data` (Object): The composed data for the page or component. This data will have passed through complete data composition, including `model.js` files and renderer specific models. This is the data you'll send to your templating language or formatting logic.
- `meta` (Object): This object contains three crucial properties:
  - `locals` (Object): The [Express locals object](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#res.locals) that has also been annotated by Amphora. This is the same `locals` object passed to component's `model.js` files during composition.
  - `_ref` (String): This is the uri that was requested to be rendered. If you're rendering a `page` or an Express route, this will be the page uri. If you're rendering a component directly, this will be the component's uri.
  - `_layoutRef` (String): This is only provided when rendering a `page` and it's value corresponds to the `layout` uri on the page. This is needed for finding the root template when rendering with different templating languages, such as Handlebars.
- `res` (Object): Simply the [Express Response](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html#res) object. This means **it is the responsibility of the renderer to terminate the response**.

An example renderer:

```javascript
module.exports.render = function (state, res) {
  var htmlResponse = ...; // Use state object to construct some HTML response..

  res.html(htmlResponse);
};
```
Having access to the Express Response object (`res`) means a renderer can attach custom headers, choose the response type and any other task you might need.
