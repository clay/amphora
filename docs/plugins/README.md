# Plugins

> #### warning::API Notice
> Plugin functionality will change in Amphora v7.0.0, with many of the methods being deprecated in favor of using the [Event Bus](../topics/event-bus.md). Please upgrade to Amphora v6.6.0 as soon as possible and transition to using Event Bus topics.

Plugins allow for you to extend functionality in Amphora by tapping into lifecycle hooks in Amphora to perform secondary actions on the server.

**Important:** none of the plugin hooks allow you to manipulate the data that Amphora is processing, they only provide awareness of what has already been processed.


## List of Hooks

- `routes`
- `save`
- `delete`
- `publish`
- `publishPage`
- `createPage`
- `schedulePage`
- `unschedulePage`
- `unpublish`
- `unpublishPage`

For more information about the arguments they receive, [see the hooks page](hooks.md). For an example of how to make a plugin, see the [Writing A Plugin](writing-a-plugin.md) page.
