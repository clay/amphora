## Introduction

Amphora is a mixin for [Express](https://github.com/strongloop/express) that:

* Composes components into renderable pages
* Uses any key-value store of your choice (e.g., Mongo, Redis, LevelDB, etc.)
* Provides an API for managing instances of components, uris, and pages

[Components are reusable, configurable, self-contained bits of the web.](https://github.com/nymag/amphora/wiki#clay-is-divided-into-components)

Amphora is a core part of New York Media's upcoming Clay project, an open-source content management system.

It follows semver and is stable as of v1.0.0.

## Installation

```
npm install --save amphora
```

## Usage

Clay separates concerns into two main areas: components and sites. Create two new directories in your project:

```
/components  (where your custom components live)
/sites       (for site-specific settings, routes, and assets)
```

In your project's main server file (e.g. `app.js`), instantiate a new Amphora instance.

```js
var amphora = require('@nymdev/amphora'),
  port = process.env.PORT || 3000;

return amphora()
  .then(function (server) {
    server.listen(port);
  });
```

For additional configuration, you may pass in an Express app / router. You can also override the default templating engine(s) with your own.

```js
var app = require('express')(),
  amphora = require('@nymdev/amphora'),
  nunjucks = require('nunjucks'),
  port = process.env.PORT || 3000,
  env;

// add project-specific settings to your app
app.set('strict routing', true);
app.set('trust proxy', 1);

env = nunjucks.configure();
// add custom settings to your templating engine
env.addGlobal('projectName', process.env.PROJECT_NAME);

return amphora({app: app, engines: {nunjucks: env} })
  .then(function (server) {
    server.listen(port);
  });
```

### How to create a component

Components in Clay have the following structure:
```
/component-name     unique name of your component
    template.html   your template
    schema.yml      describes how the component's data is edited
```

All of these files are optional.

### How to create a template

Clay Components can be made with over 30+ templating languages using [multiplex-templates](https://github.com/nymag/multiplex-templates), such as [jade](https://github.com/jadejs/jade), [mustache](https://github.com/mustache/mustache.github.com),
[handlebars](https://github.com/wycats/handlebars.js/),
[nunjucks](https://github.com/mozilla/nunjucks),
[react](https://github.com/facebook/react).

Name your template with an identifying extension and Clay will render it with the corresponding engine. For example, `template.jade` will render with Jade, and `template.html` will simply render unprocessed html.

### How to create a schema

[Kiln](https://github.com/nymag/clay-kiln) uses a component's schema.yml to determine how it is edited. For example, if you want to edit the data in this template:

```html
<article>
  <h1>{{ title }}</h1>
  <p>{{ story }}</p>
</article>
```
You would create a schema.yml file that looks like:

```yaml
title:
  _label: Title
  _placeholder: Type your title here
  _has: text
story:
  _placeholder: Type your life story here
  _has: textarea
```

More details about schema.yml are available in the [Kiln](https://github.com/nymag/clay-kiln) project.

## Contribution

Fork the project and submit a PR on a branch that is not named `master`. We use linting tools and unit tests, which are built constantly using continuous integration. If you find a bug, it would be appreciated if you could also submit a branch with a failing unit test to show your case.
